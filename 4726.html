                Cycling with headphones is a bad idea. That's why riders who want to get their groove on sometimes carry
                along a small speaker, but that speaker needs to play loudly and be able to take a beating.
            </p>

                So, you know, something like the
                <a href="http://mashable.com/category/sol-republic/">
                    Sol Republic
                </a>
                Punk, a rugged and lightweight Bluetooth speaker, which can belt out tunes at 5.7 watts. In the same
                style as last year's
                <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/01/motorola-deck-review/">
                    Deck speaker
                </a>
                , the Punk is smaller and lighter "micro-portable" design, which makes it easier to lug around. A
                quarter-inch threaded mount on the bottom helps in that department, too.

                I had a little ears-on time with the Punk, and it did a good job of filling a medium-sized conference
                room with sound. Even at maximum volume, which was plenty loud, there was very little distortion.
                There's a mini-jack for connecting a non-wireless player or daisy-chaining multiple speakers.

                The volume and playback buttons on the side are plus-size â€” all the better to feel them when you should
                be keeping your eyes on the bike path. Battery life is rated at eight hours, and the speaker will stream
                music from your phone even if you're 60 feet away.
            </p>

                The exterior of the Punk is the same rubberized material as the Deck, although in the Punk's case it
                feels even more durable. Sol Republic says it's water-, dust- and shock-resistant, and when you hold it
                in your hand, you believe it. This thing's built like a hockey puck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Available in blue, red and black, the Punk goes on sale Tuesday for $69.99.
