                phone carrier does this, but Ubiquiti’s customers, unlike your phone carrier, use unlicensed spectrum.
                That is, they don’t have an exclusive license from the Federal Communications Commission to transmit.
                Instead, they send their signals over certain, limited frequencies that have been set aside for anyone
                to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ubiquiti has focused its engineering talent on strengthening signals, sending them through cluttered
                airwaves, and filtering signal from noise at the other end. This has created for them a large customer
                base in emerging markets, where there’s less capital to spare for expensive fiber-optic networks. It’s a
                market large enough that Pera has been able to buy the Memphis Grizzlies. But there are also places in
                America, mostly rural, where wired infrastructure is too expensive to build. And there are places in
                America, mostly urban, where wired Internet access is too expensive to pay for.

                . I went to a meeting of them last year; WISPs, as they call themselves, tend to be small, run by
                engineers who get a kick out of solving problems while hanging by a clip from the top of a tower. It’s
                an industry still small enough that it calls its annual national conference “WISPapalooza.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The companies that use licensed spectrum — like your cellphone carrier — have pull in Washington, both
                directly and through trade groups like the
                <a href="http://www.ctia.org/" target="_blank">
                    CTIA
                </a>
                . They need to, because they can’t operate without the licenses that come from the FCC. The WISPs, thus
                far, have no pull, because all they’ve needed from Washington is unlicensed spectrum, a public good that
                Washington already provides.

            <p>
                It’s unfortunate but true that members of Congress, if they don’t have anyone calling them about an
                issue, assume that it’s unimportant and move on to the stuff that everyone’s yelling about. Which means
                that public goods don’t do well in Washington unless they happen to line up with some large company’s
                commercial interests. Net neutrality, like unlicensed spectrum, lowers the barrier to entry for new
                companies, and has found (somewhat) committed proponents as

                . Facebook more than tripled its lobbying spend last year as well. (Although, these companies are only
                as benevolent as their own interests will allow them to be. On net neutrality, they line up on the same
                side as consumer groups. On privacy, they square off against them.)

                This is the challenge that Ubiquiti, with its new network of WISPs, has to overcome. There are a lot of
                people in Washington who are paid to demand that the FCC free up more spectrum and license it to mobile
                phone carriers. They’ve been yelling about it for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there’s little understanding in Congress that unlicensed spectrum can generate economic activity,
                too, even though no one owns exclusive access to it. In February, Yochai Benkler, a fellow at Harvard’s
                Berkman Center for Internet and Society,
                <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2012/unlicensed_wireless_v_licensed_spectrum"
                    target="_blank">
                    made a case for the potential of this market
                </a>
                , pointing out that 87% of health-care wireless applications, for example, use unlicensed spectrum.
                Regulation hasn’t caught up with technology, Benkler argued. The FCC shouldn’t just be protecting
                unlicensed bands, but expanding them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benkler’s academic ideas line up nicely with Ubiquiti’s financial interests, which gives the company a
                chance to champion what to Washington is still a new idea. I ask Foster what bands, in particular, he’s
                interested in lobbying the FCC to free up for unlicensed use.

                </span>
                is his answer. The Ubiquiti World Network is going to hire a lobbyist, he says. “We’re a little bit
                green, but we have committed some money.”
